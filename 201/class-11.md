### In the console type

```js
document.getElementById('levees');
//show the audio tag,  now set to var
var audio = document.getElementById('levees');
audio.play();
//plays the audio
// how do we make it stop?
// audio.stop()?
audio.pause()

```

### What do you think this javascript looks like for a button like this

- Math.random()?
- set as the volume of the audio element.
- grab the button by id ?
- probably belongs to a function
- add an event listener // listen for click event.

### We can add another event listener here that does this

```js
randomizer.addEventListener('click',function(){
    console.log('You clicked the volume button.');
});
```

### CSS Grid

- **Why**
    - With CSS grid, we can work with rows **and** columns together, where flexbox
     only allowed to us to work with rows **or** columns. This allows us to build
      more complex and organized designs.
- **What**
    - Grid is a layout system that allows you to set up a series of row and column
     lines and place items within specified segments of the page based on the
      row/column number.
- **How**
    - Use a CodePen or VSCode to demonstrate grid.
    - Instructor may also pass on the following site to students to help them
     with grid practice: [CSS Grid Garden](https://cssgridgarden.com/)
