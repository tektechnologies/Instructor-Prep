while(condition){..Condition has to change..} for the while loop to stop.
for(setup; condition; change Variable)
- for loop is another way to control flow of script
- 3 statements, 1. set up 2 check the variable 3. update the variable. 

for(var i = 0; i < value; i ++)

var names = ['Keith','Kevin'];

for(var i = 0; i < names.length; i++){
    console.log(names[i]);
}
