# Programming Concepts Covered

**Hello, good morning, happy day…,** 

### Explain the lab for today and Tuesday and that the 
lab saturday is chocolate pizza and explain the format of the lab activity. 

- Ties in the wireframe lab today as practice for tomorrow’s lab. 
- What questions do you have about that for now? 


## Todays' CSS practice 
We will look at some information pertaining to laying out our pages, and look at how to start those style assignments. 
With the styling assignments, provide guidance on how to approach the problem domain, start from top to bottom, and use printouts and draw some boxes. 

Use an example of a wireframe that you’ve drawn, then ask the student to start identifying the components of the wireframe and translate them into html elements. 


 # Mob Debug the class lab's first hour. 
- Pull Request with repo to push. 
- parseInt has to be an integer number. Will not include the decimal if you try and type one in. 
- event.preventDefault(); Keeps the page from refreshing. 
- Number type returns a string? new feature js doesnt always break becuase type coercion it see the types as numbers to do the math. 

- step value in the input  ```js <input step=".01"> ````


- having the prototyp makes it so that we have access to our constructor so that we can do things like add event listeners and reuse our code. 


- because I have not commited on master I can still run normal commands to create a branch and the changes will be applied. 

- store data must be run before the hourly array data is being run, if we try to grab something from an array that is undefined and undefined plus undefined is Nan.

- Call after render table. 


- Do git remote -v
- git remote set-url origin to your repo. 

- Make sure to only call the prototype functions on the individual new object not rerun the the whole of all the objects when program starts. 


- for random we add the 1 to create the ceiling and then use Math.floor to be able to get to the bottom of random range. 


- return is a hard stop on any function. so if we return inside the loop the loop will stop. 


- Find the responsible peice of code and change it to do something better instead. 

- If something is going wrong we dont wnat to add more to fix the problem. 

- Modify code and reduce refactoring when possible. 
- debugger 
- console this before this 
newDataRow.textContent = this.shopName.

- Start the debugger and stop and check the this.shopName to see if you get it again. 
# Working in the console today 


### What is NaN 
-       5 = ['apple'];












# white boarded several code challenges

- js review -
- verify there work
- we will have about 7 chances to solve some challenges









# CSS REVIEW 
# inline-block 
**display: inline-block Value**
Compared to **display: inline**, the major difference is that display: inline-block allows to set a width and height on the element.

# inline 
**display: inline-block** the top and bottom margins/paddings are respected, but with **display: inline** they are not.

# Block
**display: block**, the major difference is that display: inline-block does not add a line-break after the element, so the element can sit next to other elements.
