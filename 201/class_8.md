# Programming Concepts Covered
# 2 hours on code review today. 


```js
'use strict';
// javascript connected
console.log('js connected');

// Problem Domain
//Create a new branch for today’s lab.
// Replace all of your object literals for the salmon cookie stand with a single constructor function that, when called with the ‘new’ keyword, it creates a new instance.
 
//calculate cookies sold per hour
//calculate cookies sold per day
 
//build a single table of data using render().
//Get the table from the html.
//create a row.
//create a td.
//get city name and set to text content.
//append that td to the table row.
//loop through the hours length, create td's w/ text content of cookies sold per hour then append td to the row.
//then append tr to table.
 
//Now render the bottom row the day hourly totals from each store added up.
//for each city in the cities array add to the hourly total that cities total for that hour after looping through all the cities, create a td and set the textcontent to hourly total and append it to the row.
// When I see this I know that I am going to need some html basically a table setup
//6:00am7:00am8:00am9:00am10:00am11:00am12:00pm 1:00pm2:00pm3:00pm4:00pm5:00pm6:00pm7:00pm  Daily Location Total
 
// Seattle                                                          
// Tokyo                                                            
// Dubai                                                            
// Paris                                                            
// Lima                                                         
// Totals              
 
// Each cookie stand location should have a separate render() method that creates and appends its row to the table
// The header row and footer row are each created in their own stand-alone function
//Put our function calls here.
```
- It’s ok that students feel confused with the nested loop. 2 parts to writing good code. 
- Organize what it is going to do
- Translate strategy into the code. 


### Do the form in the html even if you have the js skills, good advice. 
# Show Class 8. html forms and js evens. on Screen.
# Announcements.
- We are going to look at two new concepts today, with code review and how constructors work and then add in forms and events. More new Javascript concepts, today's will be just as challenging. This is the second of the two hardest days of 201. 
- Any logistical questions? How are you all feeling? Thumbs? 
- Side waysizes

- Code Review is a time for us to review code together. Try to expand on the code review solutions, to not just implement to code but understand it, so as to be able to create your own code. 
- Does the student have a ReadMe. file. It is vital to document your code correctly. To comunicate to other developers how your program works and what requirements there are for the application to perform correctly. 
- Make sure to have, several format properties added to your page layout. 
- Is the math right? You should check your math outcomes. You could add customers to the count of one. So that you can easily see the math outcome.
- Lets find the constructor and review what it is doing? 
- Update the customers to one and the avg cookies to one as well. 
- Does it work? check in the table. 
## Know how the totals row works
## Know how to set the names on the left side
## totals for each hour
## how the table is being made 
## how are we populating the table
- Before we jump into code lets look at what our code is doing. 
- Lets look at the strategy of what the code is doing. 
- What are the three or four main jobs that our javascript is doing things in. 
- Look at each others code.
