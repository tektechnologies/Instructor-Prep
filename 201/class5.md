# Programming Concepts Covered

## Partner Power hours are mandatory at Code Fellows. 

## Pair Programming Debrief
- learning from partner while driving
- talking about how code works as navigator is also a skill. 
- navigator still has control
- style nitpicks or variable name nitpicks. 



# Code Review

1. Look at web page, check out the css, and how its working. 
- Show them how to identify, errors in the code, the left side bar shows little red boxes. We can fix those issues with hovering over the red lines, and selecting the "fix all" options. 

# Base 16 and Hex code. 

134, a normal number. 
the one's place, the 10's place and the hundredths place as we move past ten we add a 1 and then start at 0 in the one's position again.
100 X 1 + 3 X 10 + 4 x 1 = 134
This is a decimal, base 10 mathmatical, 

With Computers there are two binary system
## Binary 
- are zero's and one's, because it is base 2. 
- we count from zero to 1 and then begin again. 
- So we start at the 1's position and then move to the 2's position and then the 4's position and then the 8's position, 16th, 32nd place, we multiply by two each time. 
thumbs on base 10.
- so if we have a number in binary 101 then that means we have one 1 and zero 2's and one 4's. (1 x 4 + 1 x 1) That number in binary is what we call 5 in decimal. (101 === 5). We use binary in computers because it is easy for the computer to compute whether a value is on or off, a 1 or a 0. And we can stick those 0 and 1's together to make, the numbers we need. 

Binary is base 2. All zero's and one's. Then move to the next spot over. 
Decimal is base 10. Count 0 - 9.

In binary decimal points work the same as in decimal, with usually dont have to think about those, the 1/10's space the 1/2 space and then 1/4 and so on. 

# HEX code. and RGB Values. 

so we can specify our desired colors in RGB by the number of red, number of green and number of blue. 
 The number 256 is an important number (16x16) 0r 2 to the 8th. 
 If we use base 16, we have a one's place and then a 16th's place and then a 256th's place, so all of our possible color values fit into and what that makes convenient is that all our possible values fit into just two digits of HEXIDecimal. So we can always use two digits to represent a HEX number, which is how they came up with Hexadecimal. 
### #RRGGBB 
 In base 16 we need something that means the number 10 (0-9 and then A)
 0
 1
 2
 3
 4
 5
 6
 7
 8
 9
 A - 10
 B - 11
 C - 12
 D - 13
 E - 14
 F - 15
 E - 16( We go into Second Place Number)

Decimal 16 is equal to 10
Decimal 17 is equal to 11
Decimal 25 is equal to 19
Decimal 26 is equal to 1A
Decimal 31 is equal to 1F

This is how Hex codes work. 
                        
FFFFFF  is equal to (15 X 16) + (15 X 1) = 255
