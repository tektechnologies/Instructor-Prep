# Programming Concepts Covered






# Talk about the project. 
- Explain Plan for the rest of the class.
- List out activities for assignemnts for class. 
- There are READ.me requirements for the project, so that will be a good opportunity to practice some mark down and you can speak to that refresher of practicing throughout project week
- Share insights to project technical requirements. 

# 3 Show the project requirements






# Discuss meet up oportunities.
- Does everyone have an idea of some event that they plan to attend? 


# Code Review.  Bus Mall
- 301 has Read Me requirements for each lab, there is a template and you will have to fill that out so, be ready for that. 

- What does .gitignore do? 
- You can avoid accidently commiting those file that you do not want to commit to git hub. Like the ds_store file that macs create and will include to push if you do not have the ingore file. Which will be even more important in 301. 
- You can create certain setting in VS code that are project specific. 
- look at the git ignore and show the files that you do not want to commit. 
- What questions do you have about git ignore. 
- show the link to the gitignore. link URL
- You DO want to push the git ignore to github so that other people can get the same project settings for is needed to run the application correctly. 

# Open up the console. 
- I usually open the console when I am working in javascipt so that I can see the console logs I work through some code. 
- If I am working css I like to use a second monitor where I can see a full display and have a screen with two windows with one screen with css code and the dev tools with the elements window open to trouble shoot the present.

## Open Site and run it. 
- Look at commit history. 
- Open the Site and click through. 
## Master BRANCH 
**Make sure Master Branch is Merged**

# What to look for :
- Look at Chart Js stuff. 
- Look at Styling issues. 
- Get student input on what to look at. 
- Check the image logic. Is it working how can we tell? 
- Notice the Random color generator. 
- Does the image know it has been viewed. 

## Check array to see views 
Does it count the first views? 
In the console type - allViews[0]
- You could count up those items as well. 
- go into the array 
- create a 
```js
var sum = 0;
for(var i =0; i < allVotes.length; i++){
    sum += allVote[i].imageview;
}
```


# Issue with list showing up 3 times. 
- Look in the function that is generating the list. 
- How do you find the peice of code? 
## Find the id in the browser and locate the same id in the file. 
- But that sometimes doesn't work. 
## Seeing a problem on the site and finding the code efficiently is a real skill to have. 
- You will have some time during project week where you feel comfortable with the code especially stuff you have created or worked on and you mey have to review code that you have not worked on and you will have try and figure what it is doing so that you know before you accept the pull request and merge to a live site that it will not break the site or create weird behaviors. 
## Add a debugger. 
- Change vote total to five. 
## One thing the Sources in the inspector shows us is the call stack. 
- Get a thumbs do you use the debugger in your code? 
- You can step through your entire file with it to see what is happening each step of the way. 
- You Can set up break point in the Sources by clicking on the line Numbers. 
- Then refresh the code.
