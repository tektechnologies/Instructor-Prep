# Programming Concepts Covered
## Today's Agenda
1. Announcements
2. Code Review of lab 5A
3. Lecture. JavaScript Objects
4. Introduce Salmon Cookies. (Finish each lab before moving forward.)

# Announcements 

- This week we will have one on one meetings. 
- Cover feedback information from week one. 
- cover git diff? 

# What is the hardest thing about writing code?
- There are many common answers to this question:
1. Learning a new technology
2. Naming things
3. Testing your code
4. Debugging
5. Fixing bugs
6. Making software maintainable

# What we will work on today. 
- Translate a real-world problem domain into a code model.
- Browser represents an HTML document as an object that can be manipulated with JavaScript.
- Use JavaScript to dynamically render array data as an unordered list in the DOM
- Demonstrate an understanding of how object literals are structured in JavaScript
- how to access and reassign values/functionality to their properties and methods
- Demonstrate an understanding of how dot notation and bracket notation are used to access/reassign properties and methods in JavaScript objects.

## Code Review
  - Discuss lab 5
  -  Demonstrate how to solve the problems from the lab.
  - This is also their first exposure to callbacks, so point out that the inner function will evaluate first, then be used as an argument to the outer function, as in the `sumAndMultiply` and `sumArray` functions.
  
## Template Literals
A smaller topic for today is the introduction of ES6 template literals. Show students how to refactor the concatenation from week 1 into template literals.


### Solution 1
  function sum(a,b){ //eslint-disable-line
  var theSum = a + b;
  var message = 'The sum of ' + a + ' and ' + b + ' is ' + theSum + '.';
  return [theSum, message];
}
### Problem 2
1. What data type is our return statement?
2. What are at index 0 and index 1. 
3. What is going on with that string.
4. Instead of single qoutes and plus sign
5. Use back tics, by the one key.
6. Using dollar sign and curly brac to pull in those variables.
7. Template literal: uss backticks instead of single qoutes.  
8. Using backticks alert me as a dev that something weird is about to happen. If I am writing a regular string, I will just write it as a string.   
9. The template literal does make things shorter and more readable and I can more easily see what the out come of the line will be. 

#### TODO: Write your code here
function multiply(a,b){
    return [a * b, `The product of ${a} and
    &{b} is ${a * b}. `];
}
# Console Log Demo 
- sum(4,7) returns an array
- sum(4,7) + 11 returns a string value with the sum answer concating to the 11. Looking like 11.11
- var ans = sum(4,7);
- ans.push(12)
- returns, the array with 12 at the end. 

- If I wanted to get the first element out of this array what would I do?
- ans[0] give me the first thing out of that array.
- we could do this -
- sum(3,7)[0] - this is the number ten. Which we can now use as an argument to another sum. 
- So sum(sum(3,7)[0], 5);
- Will give us sum(10,5) === 15 ===[15]

- So we start out small and build up to get the answer we are looking for. 
- When I call sum it always returns an array with the number at the first elements and the string which is th second position number 1. 
- So if we put in a one it will return the string. I can access the element using the bracket notation. 

- So, I can also sum(sum(3,7)[0], 5)[0] can grab back the next step value in the console, and now I have a value that I was looking for, now I am ready to add some code. 
- So I can follow the same pattern in the mulitply functions and get the first element back from the array. 
- multiply(multiply(a,b)[0], c)[0];

### Problem 3

// TODO: Write your code here
function sumAndMultiply(a,b,c){ //eslint-disable-line
  var theSum = sum(sum(a, b)[0] ,c)[0];
  console.log(theSum )
  
  var product = multiply(a, multiply(b,c)[0])[0];
  return [theSum, product, `${a} and ${b} and ${c} sum to ${sumAnswer}. `,
  `The product of ${a} and ${b} and ${c} is {product}.  `];  
  return [theSum, product, message1, message2];
}
# The What is that game.
# //////////////////////////////////
- multiply(a, multiply(b,c)[0])[0];

- data type of a, b, multiply. 
- a is a parameter passed in a  Number and b too. 
- multiply is a function 
- b and c are Numbers. 
- they are together an array, with a num and a string. 
- [0] gives us the number out of the array. 
- c is also a number 
- object is always a good answer because everything in javascript is an object, but multiply returns an array. 
- so the second multiply function that returns an array, has a [0] that just returns the number. 

### Problem 4
// TODO: Write your code here
var testArray = [2,3,4]; //eslint-disable-line
function sumArray(sumArr){ //eslint-disable-line
  var theSum = sum(sumArr[0], sum(sumArr[1], sumArr[2])[0])[0];
  var message = sumArr + ' was passed in as an array of numbers, and ' + theSum + ' is their sum' + '.';
  return [theSum, message];
}
### Problem 5
// Write your code here
function multiplyArray(multArr){ //eslint-disable-line
  var product = multiply(multArr[0], multiply(multArr[1], multArr[2])[0])[0];
  var message = 'The numbers ' + multArr + ' have a product of ' + product + '.';
  return [product, message];
}
### STRETCH GOAL: Problem 6
var testDynamicArray = [1,2,3,4,5]; 
function multiplyAnyArray(dynamicArray) { 
  var product = 1;
  for(var i = 0; i < dynamicArray.length; i++) {
    product *= dynamicArray[i];
  }
  var message = 'The numbers ';
  for(i = 0; i < dynamicArray.length; i++){
    message += dynamicArray[i];
    if(i < dynamicArray.length - 1) {
      message += ',';
    }
  }
  message += ' have a product of ' + product + '.';
  return [product, message];
}
// Here is the test for multiplyArray(); uncomment it to run it
testMultiplyAnyArray(testDynamicArray);


# this ends review and the first break. 
#  this ends the code review.

## Domain modeling (30 min)

# Domain Modeling
 [HERE](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/domain-modeling/).
- Domain Modeling is a way to describe real world entities and their relationships between them. How do we store that data in a way that makes sense. 
- We can take a problem domain and extract from them system requirements by determining what entities are involved and the relationships required. The system architect is usually the one responsible for domain modeling and emulates it through drawings that highlight the "verbs" of each action that takes place within the system and how it links in the overall data flow. Domain modeling allows stakeholders and development teams to better understand the needs of the application and what components/entities are required. 
- By creating a familiar problem domain, I found that both the tasks of me teaching a new technology and the viewer learning that technology were much easier, because it is very difficult to learn more than one thing at once.
- The real world is a messy place.  Many of the problem domains we face as programmers are difficult to understand and look completely different depending on your viewpoint.

- As programmers, we also are often not given complete information about the problem domain, so we donâ€™t even have the information we need to understand it.

- Can it be easy, "I was essentially given the entire problem domain in the form of a spec that was clear and unambiguous.  I was easily able to learn that problem domain and because of it, I was able to write the code very easily as well." website article.

- What can you do about it?
If understanding the problem domain is the hardest part of programming and you want to make programming easier, you can do one of two things:

### Make the problem domain easier
1. Get better at understanding the problem domain.
2. You can often make the problem domain easier by cutting out cases and narrowing your focus to a particular part of the problem.

It ultimately comes down to how the problem is organized and defined. It is important to stress that there is no substitute for good planning, and that if a problem seems too big to effectively define, then it needs to be broken down more. There are two articles on this subject, [one by a former Code Fellows instructor (Ryan Sobol)](https://github.com/codefellows/domain_modeling#domain-modeling) and another by [a tech education entrepreneur](https://simpleprogrammer.com/2013/07/15/understanding-the-problem-domain-is-the-hardest-part-of-programming/). It's a good time to talk about some business parts of the tech industry and the basic economics of how people get paid to do this work.



- Arrays 
1. Store multiple pieces of data
2. access data with square brackets. 
3. data has index (number) and the index in arrays start at 0. 
4. idices give us order 

## Object literal notation (30 min)
# Lecture Notes
# White board these 

- Objects - store multiple piecs of data 
1. Access data w/square brackets or dot notation. 
2. Store multiple pieces of data 
3. data has a key and a value, 
    - keys are strings.
    - no order, just keys. 
    - Keys have a one way direction. 
    - We look up values by there crust.

- Curly Braces allow us to {}
1. store code block within a function. 
2. They also allows to wrap our if statements to control our logic rules. 
3. And now we will use them with our objects. 

## JavaScript Objects

var chicagoPizza = {
    crust: 'Deep Dish',

}

firstPizza.crust
firstPizza['crust']
- Both return the same value. In general I use dot notation, but there are some times when you want to use the string.

1. bracket notation that does work vs. dot notation that does not. 

firstPizza['first-pizza-location'] = 'Aurellios';

- Uncaught ref error. firstPizza.first-pizza-location //does not work. 
## JS is looking at the dashes as subtraction.
So, we cant access with dot notation. 
- Camel casing is nice here as well, so that dot notation is still a viable way to access property values. 

2. Using bracket notation is useful when I look up values through a variable. 
var keyIwantToLookUp = 'crust';

firstPizza.keyIWantToLookUp //undefined

firstPizza[keyIWantToLookUp] I can use this variable here, because the bracket notation expects a string and that is what we get from the var keyIWantToLookUp, when saved in a variable some where. 
I use dot notation more often than bracket. 

# Add another key / value pair. 
var firstPizza = {
    crust: 1,
    crustType: 'Deep Dish' 
}
firstPizza // shows crust and crustType. 

# Play the Game what are these things? 

# move from console to a js file. 
- Build out scaffolding, test links. 
- Add object, then add more properties. 
- Save an image URL of a Pizza. Put each on there own line. When defining multiple key value pairs, 
- We have stored strings, numbers, but we can also store an array, and a function
- dscriptionWords: ['cheesy','delicious','saucy']
- comma vs ; at end of the k/v pairs. 

- Data Type of firstPizza is an object. 
- Access an array with bracket notation and a number. 

##  ASK what is this its a function and what does it return. 

firstPizza.description[1].length or .toUpperCase() the whole thing is a function. 
- toUpperCase() is a function that returns a string value.
- In JavaScript, an object is an entity that contains properties that describe state and behavior of the object. 
- Properties that describe behavior are also called methods. 
 

JavaScript is what we call an object-based language. (There is a difference.)
- https://www.google.com/search?q=object+based+language+vs+object+oriented+language&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS862US862&oq=object-based+language.+vs+object+oriented+&aqs=chrome.1.69i57j0l7.8303j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8

Just about everything in JavaScript is an object. 
We create objects directly through a template (we will get to this later), 
and not through classes, like other languages. 
## Classes are still used in JavaScript but are not touched on in this course. 
There are two ways for creating an object in JavaScript that we will cover in 201:
1. Object literals 
1. Instantiating objects with the new keyword through a constructor function
# We are going to focus on object literals today and will talk about constructor functions tomorrow. 

### Object Literals
Object literals are the simplest way to create a JS object. The syntax for it is mostly based off of key/value pairs. This means that when you create your object, you define the properties (keys) of an object, you must also give it a value.


# Object Literals -  HUH? 
  goal with JS objects is to model real-life entities that have characteristics (properties) and behaviors (methods). 
  - describe properties as nouns,
  - values as adjectives,
  - methods as verbs.

Here is an example of what a JS object looks like:

```js
var person = {
	name: "Craig Barkley",
	age: 47,
	computerScientist: true,
    education: ['Southern Illinois University', 'DeltaV']
};
```

#### Note a few things about the object:
1. We create objects the same way we create variables. We start out with the declaration of the variable followed by the data we are setting the value too. 
1. The full object value is encapsulated with curly braces `{}`
1. Each set of data in the object is known as a property. This is showcased through a key/value pair. The "key" is the name of the property, and the "value" is the value stored in the property. For example, the `name` property is the key, and the value of `"Craig Barkley"` is the value. This means that within the object, the "name" of the person is "Craig Barkley". The same thing is true for the key `age`. The key is `age` the value is `47`. 
1. After every property, if there is another one to follow, we end with a comma `,`.
1. Properties can store any valid javascript value, even other objects.  


```js
console.log(person.name) // Craig Barkley
console.log(person.age) // 47
console.log(person.education) // Southern Illinois University, DeltaV
```

#### Object Methods
Methods in an object are the behaviors/actions of an object. For example, our `person` object should be able to actually "do" things, not just hold properties. Our `person` should be able to...walk. This means we should give our person this capability. We do this through what we call methods. At first sight, methods look like properties. That is because they are, method is the name we give to "properties" that have the values of functions. Here is an example, using our `person` from above:

```js
var person = {
	name: 'Craig Barkley',
	age: 47,
	computerScientist: true,
    education: ['Southern Illinois University', 'DeltaV'],
    code: function() {
  	console.log('I am coding now!....");
  }
 };
```

The first thing we can notice about or newly added method is that it is an anonymous function. This means that there is no "name" to the function, just simply an associated property. 

If we wanted to "call" this method within our object, we would simply call it by first specifying the object, then the name of the method. 

```js
person.walk(); // output: I am walking....
```

#### Contextual 'this'
The term `this` is a bit tricky to understand at first. The easiest way to explain what `this` is, is by explaining to them that the `this` is directly talking about whatever object is currently being manipulated. For example, if we were to modify the current `person.walk()` method to output the name of the current person, we would have to use the contextual `this`. 


```js
var person = {
	name: "Craig Barkley",
	age: 47,
	computerScientist: true,
    education: ['Southern Illinois University', 'DeltaV'],
    walk: function() {
  	console.log( this.name + ' am walking....");
  }
 };
```

What is happening here is when we call `person.walk`, it is going to take the current object that is in the context and currently being called on, and use that piece of data when outputting the name. 

If we were to create 2 different object literals:

```js
var person1 = {
	name: "Craig Barkley",
	age: 47,
	computerScientist: true,
    education: ['Southern Illinois University', 'DeltaV'],
    walk: function() {
  	console.log( this.name + ' is walking....");
  }
 };

var person2 = {
	name: "Sally Joe",
	age: 30,
	computerScientist: true,
    education: [Harvard University],
    walk: function() {
  	console.log( this.name + ' is walking....");
  }
 };

person1.walk() // output: Craig Barkley is walking
person2.walk() // output: Sally Joe is walking
```


#### Nested Object 

In addition to having an object with properties and methods, we can also have "nested" objects within a JS object. Here is an example:

```js
var person = {
	name: "Grace Hopper",
	age: 85,
	computerScientist: true,
    education: [Vassar College, Yale University],
    walk: function() {
  	console.log('I am walking....");
  },
   birthplace: {
       date: December 9 1906,
       location: New York City, USA
   }
 };

```

Notice the new nested object of `birthplace` in our object. As you can see, we can "create" objects easily by explicitly stating the methods and properties from within them. 
























#### Adding new props

When adding NEW property methods, we will use the `=` instead of the `.` because we are assigning a value to the object. Example

```js
person.serviceBranch = 'United States AirForce';
```

As a result, `person` now has a newly added property named `serviceBranch` with a value of `United States AirForce`.




### Dot vs Bracket Notation

When accessing the properties of the object, there are two different ways to do so, dot notation and bracket notation. 

Dot notation is the more common and popular approach to accessing the properties of an object. Dot notation is specifying the object directly and calling the name of the property through a dot `.`. The reason this is preferred over bracket is because it is easier to read and less verbose. 

Example: `foo.bar` <-- foo is the name of the object; bar is the name of the property. 

Bracket notation is when we access a property on an object through the use of brackets `[]`. Specifically, accessing the name of the property attached to the object. Using the same example as above, we would access the `bar` property of the `foo` object by writing `foo['bar']`

[HERE](https://codeburst.io/javascript-quickie-dot-notation-vs-bracket-notation-333641c0f781) is an article that explains the highlights of the two notations.  





















## The DOM (30 min)


## The DOM
"The DOM" (Document Object Model) is where the HTML and CSS that we have been learning about this whole time come together to create a very powerful document that we use in our browsers. Within our browser, when looking at a webpage, we see HTML and CSS come together to create a structure that we can in turn see headings, images, links etc....

Browsers represent the html document as a JS object. This means that we can access individual components of "The DOM" the same way we would access individual components of a JS object. 

Here is a quick exercise to prove this point: 

1. type `document` in the console within your browser
1. find `document.body`
1. actually type in `document.body`
1. change the document.body.textContext = 'to something else'
1. look at all the options on the `document.` dot notation.

Within the `document` object, we have a method in there called `getElementById`. This allows us to "get a specific element within the HTML by specifying the id"

One thing to note **we can only add one thing at a time**.

If we wanted to add a `<p>` tag to our page, inside of say, an `<article>`, we can. The article that we want to add the `p` tag into though, **must have a unique id attached to it**. 

```HTML
<article id="parentElement">
</article>
```

Here is the JS code to add a `p` tag to our `article`

```javascript
var parent = document.getElementById('parentElement');  
var child = document.createElement('p');  
child.textContent = 'Some words we want in our p element';  
parent.appendChild(child);
```

```HTML
<div id="parent">
  <p>Some words we want in our p element</p>
</div>
```

There is a lot of potential for DOM manipulation and JS objects. We could potentially make a `render` method on one of the JS objects that can render these new HTML tags as a list to our page when called:

```js
render: function(){
  var parent = document.getElementById('parentElement');
    for(var i=0; i < myArray.length; i++){
      var newTag = document.createElement('li');
      newTag.textContent = myArray[i];
      parent.appendChild(newTag);
    }
}
```

























# JavaScript Objects

## What Is an Object?
JavaScript objects are convenient & powerful ways to group data and functions. They store data as **properties**, which are represented as `key: value` pairs, and can have **methods**, which are functions associated with the object.

Similar to arrays, but with semantic element names:

```javascript
var myArray = ['a', 'b', 'c'];

var myObject = {
	0: 'a',
	1: 'b',
	2: 'c'
};
```

Arrays are great for storing similar pieces of data, but get confusing if they contain mixed data.

```javascript
var samArray = ['Sam', null, 'Hamm', 0, true, ['Nadia', 'Spencer', 'Dan']];
```


```javascript
var person = {
	name: "Adam Wallraff",
	age: 30,
	isWalking: false,
	walk: function(){
		console.log(this.name + ' is now walkin down the streetz');
		this.isWalking = true;
  };
};
```

## Notation
We can declare objects using object literal notation:

1. curly braces `{}`
1. key: value pairs - colon between k/v, comma after each pair (except the last one)
1. properties - any data type, including other objects
1. methods - function(s) associated with the object

```javascript
var emptyObject = {};
var oneLineObject = { a: 1, b: 2 };

var genericObject = {
  key1: value1,
  key2: value2,
  'multi-word key': value3,
  method: function() {
    //do stuff
  }
};
```

```javascript
var sam = {
  //properties
  firstName: 'Sam',
  middleName: null,
  lastName: 'Hamm',
  rating: 0,
  isABoss: true,
  underlings: ['Nadia', 'Spencer', 'Dan'],

  //methods
  getRating: function() {
  	return this.rating;
  },
  setRating: function(num) {
  	return this.rating = num;
  }
 };
```

## Accessing Properties & Calling Methods
1. accessing properties
   1. dot notation
   1. bracket notation - w/string, outside variable. multi-word keys
1. calling methods
   1. `objectName.method();`
   1. methods declared in context of an object must be called in that context, so calling `method();` gives an error

## Modifying Objects
1. adding new properties, methods
	1. use `=` instead of `:` because we're assigning a value

```javascript
sam.employer = {
  name: 'Code Fellows',
  location: 'Seattle'
};

sam.logName = function() {
	console.log(this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName);
};
```

1. clearing & removing
   1. set value to '', 0, or null
   1. `delete` operator

## Built-in Objects
1. String, Array, Document, Math

## Prototypes
1. Every object has a prototype. It can be assigned explicitly, or is set to the global Object by default
1. All objects have the props & methods of their prototype
1. If a prop or method can't be found on the object itself, the JS engine will look up the prototype chain for it

## this
1. complicated!
1. changes based on context.
1. when calling a method in the context of an object, `this = the object`

```javascript
sam.whatIsThis = function() {
  console.log(this);
}

sam.whatIsThis(); //logs the sam object
```


#Adding Something to the DOM

**We can only add ONE THING AT A TIME.**

As an example, let's add a `<p>` to an existing `<div>`

This is our existing HTML:

```HTML
<div id="parentElement">
</div>
```

### Steps

1. Make a JavaScript reference (a variable) to the parent element
1. Create the child element we want to add and save it as a variable
1. Give the child content - in this case, the content is text
1. Append the child to the parent

**JavaScript:**

```javascript
var parent = document.getElementById('parentElement');  
var child = document.createElement('p');  
child.textContent = 'Some words we want in our p element';  
parent.appendChild(child);
```

**Finished HTML:**

```HTML
<div id="parent">
  <p>Some words we want in our p element</p>
</div>
```
