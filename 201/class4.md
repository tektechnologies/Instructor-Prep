# Programming Concepts Covered

- Announcements. 
Fresca Shortage: Fresca has turned out to be very popular, and we went through it much faster than expected. Donna has ordered more but it’s currently on back order. As soon as it’s available, we’ll get more!

- statement vs expression, the expression does a computation, but nothing is done with it, with a statement we group expressions as a way to express our conditions to do something with the computations. so x *= 5 is explicity implying the assignment of the variable value to x. 

- Arrays are a ref datatype to hold other data. 
They are not primitive, 
Variables allow us to give things in our code human readable values that we can use throughout our code. 

- Attributes happen in html, 

var fruits = ['apple','orange','bob','fred','tom'];

Use typeof(differentThings)

Ask them what they want to look at in code review, 
- counting for correct answers X
    score++ or score = score + 1
- final score 
- going through the array of possible answers, 
- multiple trys different approaches. X

### Start with the html ul an ol lists. 


### Talk about code review,     
- So last time we worked adding some ul and ol lists, worked with conditional statements some more, and also at truthy and falsy values, 

mention that the us of the reset.css, removes the bullets, which we can change, 

- using classes are a standard best practice way of modify css, 
- usually resist using an id, because we cannot duplicate id's accross the site, 
- Not knowing how a project will end up it is best use to practice using classes so that they could potentially be reused in the future. 

### Lets look at Javascript. 

Review code and then as you come accross an issues you can demo debugger. 
open the inspector to console before you reload the page, what debugger does is stops the code where we put it and then we can step through our code to see exactly what is going on with these variables. 

Type in the variables and see what values have been assigned to the variables. 
- In case, the input is a "string" and the number is a Number 10. 
- We can fix by taking away an equal sign, which is not best practice, while that would work we want to covert, the string to a number. 
- Search number conversion javascript. 
- ParseInt, Number 

numGuess = parseInt(input);
- We can use the parseInt to chain to other methods, like numGuess = parseInt(prompt('Guess Higher'));

# Take Break for 10 Minutes.
### When we get back we will look at functions. 

- To stop loops we use break as opposed to setting a variable to the condition value for the for loop. 

- We can use the method .includes()
- returns weather or not an a
```
if(songAnswer.includes(songGues)) {
    alert('You are right'!);
    i = 6; //ends for loop
    score++
}
```
.includes() works on strings and sub strings. 


## This ends the code review. 

# now demo css layouts .
- last time we talked about the box model
