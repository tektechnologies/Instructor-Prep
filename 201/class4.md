- Announcements. 
Fresca Shortage: Fresca has turned out to be very popular, and we went through it much faster than expected. Donna has ordered more but it’s currently on back order. As soon as it’s available, we’ll get more!

- statement vs expression, the expression does a computation, but nothing is done with it, with a statement we group expressions as a way to express our conditions to do something with the computations. so x *= 5 is explicity implying the assignment of the variable value to x. 

- Arrays are a ref datatype to hold other data. 
They are not primitive, 
Variables allow us to give things in our code human readable values that we can use throughout our code. 

- Attributes happen in html, 

var fruits = ['apple','orange','bob','fred','tom'];

Use typeof(differentThings)

Ask them what they want to look at in code review, 
- counting for correct answers
- final score 
- going through the array of possible answers, 
- multiple trys different approaches.

### Start with the html ul an ol lists. 


### Talk about code review,     
- So last time we worked adding some ul and ol lists, worked with conditional statements some more, and also at truthy and falsy values, 

mention that the us of the reset.css, removes the bullets, which we can change, 

- using classes are a standard best practice way of modify css, 
- usually resist using an id, because we cannot duplicate id's accross the site, 
- Not knowing how a project will end up it is best use to practice using classes so that they could potentially be reused in the future. 

### Lets look at Javascript.
