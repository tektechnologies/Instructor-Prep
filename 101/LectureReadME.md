It's a place for developers, designers, entrepreneurs and business leaders         to come together and learn how leading experts in Modern Web technologies are               strategically making products that solve problems.                                      -  What is a Modern Web App?

   -  What is a Web Developer?                                                                    The majority of Web Developers work either on the software, database, and coding            part of a website, known as back-end, or in the design and interface part, known as         front-end. However, there are Web Developers that work on both sides and offer a            more complete service, these are called Full Stack Developers.

###       Possibly a place for the Hello World introduction 
        Brian Kernighan actually wrote the first "hello, world" program as part of the documentation for the BCPL programming language developed by Martin Richards. BCPL was used while C was being developed at Bell Labs a few years before the publication of Kernighan and Ritchie's C book in 1972.
