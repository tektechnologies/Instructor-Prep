# Programming Concepts Covered
Today is about VCS, a version control system.

Repository is often called a repo. 
When we dont use versioning - We are essentially Bloating the file system, when we can actually have only one file that we can roll back to any of the previous versions of the file or file system. 

What is a hotfix? and why is it important to have commits to follow the git pushes to production? So that we can track all changes.

How do we showcase and strategize around github for job searching.

Programming is not a memorization task, you can memeorize pieces of it. Creating apps, is an intangible process, using your words and your thought process to make things happen. 
Using git will become easy through muscle memory. Git feels though, and then it will be like wow I forgot about git hub, and you will just do it. Because you have done it so many times.  

The idea we are working towards is collaboration against my code base is the conceptual understanding. 

# Let students Read
Then I will demo 3-4 times the process, slower to faster.

After first break, do the Reflection and Discussion, while we need to do the journal, but what is more important is to read through the udemy git hub, you will have a lot of questions, over time ask them and they will get answered. Read for 15 minutes and then we are going to cover, ACP, and I will see you all in 15 minutes. Ask TA's for help if you have any high level questions. 
## Make sure to let them know that any questions that are not covered in class can be addressed in slack, after class. 

# White board A C P process.  
## show when and where git status (check to make sure it worked)
did I add things, did I commit, did it push correctly, and are all branches up to date. 

# Step one go to Git Hub . com.
Explain repositories. 
Most people ave one project per repo. 
Description shows up on repo page. 

# Notes on Terminals.  
Can you blow up your computer no.
Can you delete everything on your pc, possibly.
