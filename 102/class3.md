# Programming Concepts Covered

Today is about VCS, a version control system.

Repository is often called a repo.
When we don't use versioning - We are essentially Bloating the file system, when
we can actually have only one file that we can roll back to any of the previous
versions of the file or file system.

What is a hotfix? and why is it important to have commits to follow the git pushes
to production? So that we can track all changes.

How do we showcase and strategize around github for job searching.

Programming is not a memorization task, you can memorize pieces of it. Creating apps,
is an intangible process, using your words and your thought process to make things
happen. Using git will become easy through muscle memory. Git feels though, and
then it will be like wow I forgot about git hub, and you will just do it. Because
you have done it so many times.  

The idea we are working towards is collaboration against my code base is the
conceptual understanding.

## Let students Read

Then I will demo 3-4 times the process, slower to faster.

After first break, do the Reflection and Discussion, while we need to do the
journal, but what is more important is to read through the udemy git hub, you
will have a lot of questions, over time ask them and they will get answered. Read
for 15 minutes and then we are going to cover, ACP, and I will see you all in 15
minutes. Ask TA's for help if you have any high level questions.

## Any questions that are not covered in class can be addressed in slack, after class

## White board A C P process  

## show when and where git status (check to make sure it worked)

did I add things, did I commit, did it push correctly, and are all branches up
to date.

## Step one go to Git Hub . com

Explain repositories.
Most people ave one project per repo.
Description shows up on repo page.

## Notes on Terminals  

Can you blow up your computer no.
Can you delete everything on your pc, possibly.

## git is a base command that we always use

## I will give you access to our 102 repo

## now create the scaffolding

Starting with the touch sample.txt, we can create any file we wish and git will
track it, So, run git status. The fact that git shows the file we created as
Untracked file.

### git push origin master

git push - push to github
origin - means where to? it was the url we provided initially.
master, is the main branch. and let it live there.

Remind what was our goal?
to make a repo,
pull it down
add a file
push that file back up to git hub

### show what git hub looks like now

This is the accountability, we need and get from github.
hackyness equals duct tape, run a git blame. ? git and github allows us to take
and have accountability.
Promotions can come from showing work that you can do, employees can see that you
are performing at or above, what is required.

## So what we will do now

This class has two purposes complete 201 pre-work, we are now ready for success.
The second is to give you some exposure, mostly try as much as you can and understand
the conceptual side of what we are doing. So, that in week 2 of 201, when we start
objects, you may not know what that is, but you will by then have started to
build heuristics when it comes to what you have previously covered.

Going to do this two more times, going to talk a bit in this second run and I am
going to talk very little and more even more quickly.

cd ~ takes me to my directory directly.

code . open up vs code.

## keep bash clear and keep it up at top so students can see what you are typing

use git touch to create files, to avoid app scaffolding ending up in the wrong
location and messing up the application.

## Commit messages should not contain swear words, to be professional

and communicate the work you did properly

Remind them that they have TA's to get help from as they are working through lab.

So your job, is to pull down repo, update it and push it back up.
So, I will delete my old one, and create one more quickly, to show you the flow.
and then you will have 30 minutes with the help of the TA's to work through your
lab assignment.
I did it quickly and efficiently and didn't really have to think about it. In fact,
there will be shortcuts that you learn, that will be added in to your flow as you
go. We need to know the why, what, and how and be able to ACP to master. within
the next month.

### Read through the assignment lab

stress that the acp is happening, and yes learning journal is important, add
something but pay more attention today to the ACP process.

Explain what the stretch goals are, and that they are a developer thing as well.

### I will check back in with 15 minutes left to go

Do not be afraid, to ask what step one is. The model is to confirm what we learn
not on the day that it is taught, but over time as learning continues it will
become apparent what you know and what you don't.

Look in slack at the series of steps.

#### Step 1 - Navigate to your learning journal repo

#### Step 2 - Clone your repo down onto your local machine. git clone github-repo-url.git

#### Step 3 - cd into your repo: cd ~ to get to your home directory then, cd github-repo-name

#### Step 4 - run code . to open your learning journal in VS code

#### Step 5 - make some changes to your README.md

#### Step 6 - ACP time - start with adding your changes git add README.md

#### Step 7 - commit changes git commit -m 'add message with relevant commit information'

#### Step 8 - push your changes to GitHub. git push origin master

If you weren't able to push code that's ok, we will go through next why and then
as a group we will get there. some may not be able to do code . to work, and we
get those things taken care of next time.

explain a for loop as a funky bit of code that we will spend an hour and half,
of what it is and then you'll spend a month practicing, before we are even able
to do it from memory, we need to be able to identify the parts, html and css have
less of a barrier to understanding, then focus on js, the language of choice to
learn fundamentals and programming concepts that will transcend languages, so for
the for loop, I would be happy if you new what it was, what it is supposed to do,
takes practice, out put of class what why it is used, and you can identify its parts,
maybe not create it but knowing it at a high level. not just teaching js for the
sake of doing js.

201 reading - what am I looking at.  (get it to work)
301 writing - have a base, give me a pattern to utilize this stuff. (make it faster)
401 creating. - make your own stuff. (make it good.)

jumping out of an airplane, we have parachute. lots of graduates that have been
doing this, and making money, even get in the door, get in the loop, working as
much as possible, as a dev, and by 401, this is just what I do, I am in it. it is
constant you have to figure this out, we give you an inch, you take it a mile.
