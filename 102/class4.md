What do students remember from 101, html introductions?
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML

The name of an element inside a tag is case insensitive.
HTML is not a programming language; it is a markup language that defines the structure of your content.

## Markup
A markup language is one that is designed for defining and presenting text. HTML (HyperText Markup Language), is an example of a markup language.

## Types of markup language

#### Presentational Markup: 
Used by traditional word processing sytem with WYSIWYG (what you see it is what you get); this is hidden from human authors, users and editors. 
#### Procedural Markup:
Combined with text to provide instructions on text processing to programs. This text is visibly manipulated by the author. 
#### Descriptive Markup:
Labels sections of documents as to how the program should handle them. For example, the HTML <td> defines a cell in a HTML table
