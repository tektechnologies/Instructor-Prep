What do students remember from 101, html introductions?
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML

The name of an element inside a tag is case insensitive.
HTML is not a programming language; it is a markup language that defines the structure of your content.

# The Four Main Parts of an element
1. The opening tag. using angle brackets.
2. The closing tag. 
3. The content
4. The element - content and tags. 
Elements can also have attributes
Attributes should always have the following
1. A space between it and the element name.
2. Attribute name followed by equal sign. 
3. Attribute value wrapped by opening and closing quotations.

Note - simple attribute values can not contain 
", ', `, =, <, > or white space.

- make sure elements are properply nested.

Empty elements - have no content and is self closing meaning that there is no closing tags.

## Markup
A markup language is one that is designed for defining and presenting text. HTML (HyperText Markup Language), is an example of a markup language.

## Types of markup language

#### Presentational Markup: 
Used by traditional word processing sytem with WYSIWYG (what you see it is what you get); this is hidden from human authors, users and editors. 
#### Procedural Markup:
Combined with text to provide instructions on text processing to programs. This text is visibly manipulated by the author. 
#### Descriptive Markup:
Labels sections of documents as to how the program should handle them. For example, the HTML <td> defines a cell in a HTML table




### Semantics - relating to meaning in language or logic.
Semantic rules make communication possible. They are rules that people have agreed on to give meaning to certain symbols and words. Semantic misunderstandings arise when people give different meanings to the same words or phrases.


### Wireframes
Are a visual respresentation of the elements on a website. 
1. We can establish a heirarchy of information.(most important.) 
2. Simplifies Communication.(clients, back end developers.)  
3. Blue Print 
Use grey scale and it is a minified version of what the final app will look like. 
Users historically look to the left side for action buttons. 
we want to be able to functionally work through the site without an aesthetic distractions.
Starting each website with a wireframe can save time and money.
