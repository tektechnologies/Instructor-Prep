HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML

The name of an element inside a tag is case insensitive.
HTML is not a programming language; it is a markup language that defines the structure of your content.

2. The closing tag. 
3. The content
4. The element - content and tags. 
Elements can also have attributes
Attributes should always have the following
1. A space between it and the element name.
2. Attribute name followed by equal sign. 
3. Attribute value wrapped by opening and closing quotations.

Note - simple attribute values can not contain 
", ', `, =, <, > or white space.

- make sure elements are properply nested.

Empty elements - have no content and is self closing meaning that there is no closing tags.

## Markup
A markup language is one that is designed for defining and presenting text. HTML (HyperText Markup Language), is an example of a markup language.

## Types of markup language

#### Presentational Markup: 
Used by traditional word processing sytem with WYSIWYG (what you see it is what you get); this is hidden from human authors, users and editors. 
#### Procedural Markup:
Combined with text to provide instructions on text processing to programs. This text is visibly manipulated by the author. 
#### Descriptive Markup:
Labels sections of documents as to how the program should handle them. For example, the HTML <td> defines a cell in a HTML table
