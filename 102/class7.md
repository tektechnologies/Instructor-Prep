### Script
- Js makes web pages more interactive. 
a. Access to Content( use to grab any html elements on a page.)
b. Modify Content(add elements, change values of a css class, or change position of img)
c. Program rules(image script that runs a larger image when a thumb nail is clicked on.)
d. React to events ( button press, link click)

Script is a series of instructions given to the computer by you the developer, so that the computer can perform some type of task. (Recipes, Handbooks, Manuals)

Writing a script - Humans can easily accomplish complex goals and tasks without thinking about them to much. Computers don't learn how to do tasks, they follow rules explicitly. 
So we start with a big picture to help develop the rules, list of steps, to create a runable executable code. 
1. Define the Goal
2. Design the Script
3. Code each step. 
- Flow Charts 
- List of the Steps. 
Use a programmatic approach to problem solving and achieving goals. Computers need to be told exactly everystep of what to do, and when things go wrong and dont work we have several ways to uncover what happen, through the process of DEBUGGING. 
Programmatically - following a series of steps of instructions, one after another.

### Expression
- An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking there are two types of expressions. 
1. Expressions that assign a value to a variable     //var color = blue;
2. Expressions the  use two or more values to return a single value. //var area = 3 * 2;

### Operator
- Expression rely on things called operators, that allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values. 
#### Assignment Operators // color = blue; assigns a value to a variable
#### Arithmetic Operators // area = 3 * 2; perform basic math
#### String Operators     // greeting = 'Hi' + 'Person's Name'; Combine two strings. 
#### Comparison Operators // buy = 3 > 5;  buy value is false. 
#### Logical Operators // buy = (5 > 3) && (2 < 4); Combine expressions and return true or false.
