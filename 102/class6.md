# Programming Concepts Covered

Students will incorporate JavaScript into a web page to create dynamic content that responds to input

Students will replicate code that uses logical branching and basic conditionals to determine the outcome of content on a web page.

# Recap from Code 101
- Proceedural coding. A procedural language is a computer programming language that follows, in order, a set of commands. Examples of computer procedural languages are BASIC, C, FORTRAN, Java, and Pascal.
- Scripting Language - A scripting language is a programming language designed for integrating and communicating with other programming languages. Some of the most widely used scripting languages are JavaScript, VBScript, PHP, Perl, Python, Ruby, ASP and Tcl.
- I have worked through 3 semesters of Java, C#, php, multiple database courses and sometimes it still takes me 30 minutes to figure out what some code from 201 is doing.(pause for class laughter) So I am looking forward to learning along with you as I revisit these concepts and we learn together.

# JavaScript
- Javascript and Java are not the same thing. 
- ECMAScript os ES is a scripting-language specification standard by ECMA International. It was created to standardize JS. 
- Javascript was slow to catch on, and people thought it was a joke, because JS as a language was not high level. It was used in conjunction with websites that were for the most part had only static content aside from a contact form. There was very little behavior happening on the sites pages. 
- Now JS is the most widely used language of all time. 
- We can pretty much do anything with JS. Build IoT, Web Servers, Web Applications, Mobile Apps, Smart Watches, Games, Robots, Drones. 
- It is an amazing langauge, and because of that people still hate it, because you can build the same things in different ways. 
- With C# and Java, there are language specifications, that must be followed inorder to create working code, if the rules of the languages are not followed the programs will not compile if your classes are not constructed correctly and thusly, not work.

# data type
So, lets look at Data Types. 

1. Primitives  In JavaScript, there are 7 primitive 
-data types: 
### string
- Strings are text started with single or double quotes, best practice single qoutes. 
- JavaScript's String type is used to represent textual data. With conventions, it is possible to represent any data structure in a string. This does not make it a good idea. Use strings for textual data. When representing complex data, parse strings and use the appropriate abstraction.
ASK QUESION 
- What is '30' ? // it is a string. 
### number
- is exactly that it is a number, 1 or 27 or
 https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/MAX_SAFE_INTEGER
### boolean 
- Boolean represents a logical entity and can have two values: true, and false. 
Logic is true or false, yes or no, 1 or 0. 
### null
- The Null type has exactly one value: null. The value null represents the intentional absence of any object value. It is one of JavaScript's primitive values and is treated as falsy for boolean operations.
# undefined   
- A variable that has not been assigned a value has the value undefined.
# symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015).
The data type symbol is a primitive data type. Every symbol value returned from Symbol() is unique.
# object. 
In computer science, an object is a value in memory which is possibly referenced by an identifier.
In JavaScript, objects can be seen as a collection of properties. 
- With the object literal syntax, a limited set of properties are initialized; 
An object literal is a list of zero or more pairs of property names and associated values of an object, enclosed in curly braces ({}).
- then properties can be added and removed. 
- Property values can be values of any type, including other objects, which enables building complex data structures.
-  Properties are identified using key values. A key value is either a String or a Symbol value.
___
# variable
### Javascript Variables 
JavaScript includes variables which hold the data value and it can be changed anytime.
A string literal is zero or more characters enclosed in double (") or single (') quotation marks.
cat = 'cat'

- Naming Variables.
That was my choice to call my variable cat, cat. We have to be careful when we are naming some variables. Here is a bad example of naming variables. 

dog = 'cat'   //Bad

# FIRST PROGRAMMING LESSON. -
Spend some time thinking through the things that you are naming. 
var instructorName = 'Craig'

Which is better than 
var x = 'craig'
Many programmers bypass this and you can't!
- At DeltaV the course curriculm is set up not only to teach you how to code, but to instill best practices and developer hueristics that will make you a more valuable employee and developer.
