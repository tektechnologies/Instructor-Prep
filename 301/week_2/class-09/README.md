### Refactoring

    - Code isn't always poetry
    - You want to integrate new technologies/libraries
    - You get better and learn new things
    - You want to integrate more advanced design patterns
    - So
    - Break large functions into smaller chunks
    - Identify areas for reusable functions
    - Identify common patterns
    - Seek opportunities to extend or abstract functionality
