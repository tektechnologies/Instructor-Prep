## Lecture Outline

Below is the expected lecture outline and flow. One possible way to present this material is documented in the [example lecture](../facilitator/LECTURE-EXAMPLE.md) notes.

### Warm-Up

- **Student Analysis** (5 min)
  - Show or print the [warm-up code](../warm-up/warm-up.md)
- **Debrief** (5-10 min)
  - Refer to the [Warmup Notes](../warm-up/NOTES.md)
  - Optionally demo the running code at Repl.it

### Shred Talk

- **Why**
  - Daily "Shred Talks" introduce the student to a new javascript coding concept, setting them up to complete the daily "Code Challenge" series
- **What**
  - Refer to the [challenge documentation](../challenges/README.md)
- **How** (10 min)
  - Follow the [Demo Code](../challenges/DEMO.md)
- **Note**
  - If you are short on time, this can be omitted from class lecture. There are official videos that students can watch in lieu of you leading this portion of class.

### Code Review

- **Why** (5 min)
  - Confirm with the students that really understand the 301 fundamentals
- **What** (10 min)
  - HTML, CSS, JS
  - jQuery/Mustache
  - Express
- **How** (30 min)
  - Using student prompts ...
    - Build a **simple** dynamic web app with a template
    - Build a **simple** express server with 1 route serving JSON
    - Connect them with `$.ajax()`
  - Students should know 100% of this
  - Stress that this is boilerplate!

### Pagination

- **Why** (5 min)
  - Most APIs don't provide all the data they have
  - Rather, you'll get to all of it in chunks of, for example 10 records at a time
  - How can the user get to the data they don't see on the initial rendering, when they are ready for it?
- **What** (10 min)
  - A "get more" button is a great place to start
  - We already went to the server with `$.ajax()` to get the data to render
  - We can go back again for more to augment our display
    - We are allowing WRRC "on demand". User action triggers another request-response. 
    - This can be as simple as "get more" and append to the list, making it infinitely scrolling
    - Alternatively, add links for "Next" and "Previous" to let the user fetch a different page of results and toggle between them
  - What's the difference?
    - The calls to the server are the same.
    - It comes down to the rendering. Are you replacing what's in the target element with the data you fetch (`.html()`) or are you adding to it (`.append()`)
- **How** (30 min)
  - Demo: Pagination
- **Experimentation and Discovery Ideas**
  - Have the students drive the discovery (with gentle leadership)

### Refactoring

- **Why** (5 min)
  - Code isn't always poetry
  - You want to integrate new technologies/libraries
  - You get better and learn new things
  - You want to integrate more advanced design patterns
- **What** (10 min)
  - Break large functions into smaller chunks
  - Identify areas for reusable functions
  - Identify common patterns
  - Seek opportunities to extend or abstract functionality
- **How** (30 min)
  - Demo: Refactor simple code
  - Demo: Refactor city explorer code
- **Experimentation and Discovery Ideas**
  - Have the students drive the discovery (with gentle leadership)

## Lab Notes

- No new functionality today, this lab is all about refactoring
- Students should be encouraged to start from a stable state

## What changed from the previous class?

- Everything will change today. We're going to move away from the monolithic server.js functions and into much simpler code, possibly into modules.
- Code structure
  - Refactored Methods
  - Modular functionality

## What might students struggle with today?

- The concept of modules will be tough at first. KISS is the rule of the day.
  - No need to dive deep into the mechanics, just get the syntax right.
- Understanding the module pattern
- Making sense of what belongs where

## Past bugs, issues or surprises...

## General Comments and Notes

Students will follow the same pattern from lab 8 to retrieve data from the Movies API and the Yelp API. As a stretch goal, they should be able to quickly implement the National Parks Service API, using the same techniques.
