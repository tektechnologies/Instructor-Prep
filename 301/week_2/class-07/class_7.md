## Lecture Outline

Below is the expected lecture outline and flow. One possible way to present this material is documented in the [example lecture](../facilitator/LECTURE-EXAMPLE.md) notes.

### Warm-Up

- **Student Analysis** (5 min)
  - Show or print the [warm-up code](../warm-up/warm-up.md)
- **Debrief** (5-10 min)
  - Refer to the [Warmup Notes](../warm-up/NOTES.md)
  - Optionally demo the running code at Repl.it

### Shred Talk

- **Why**
  - Daily "Shred Talks" introduce the student to a new javascript coding concept, setting them up to complete the daily "Code Challenge" series
- **What**
  - Refer to the [challenge documentation](../challenges/README.md)
- **How** (10 min)
  - Follow the [Demo Code](../challenges/DEMO.md)
- **Note**
  - If you are short on time, this can be omitted from class lecture. There are official videos that students can watch in lieu of you leading this portion of class.

### Code Review

### Code Review / Rebuild / Review

- **Why** (5 min)
  - Lab 06 was big in concept, short on code
  - Students will need a recap on the City Explorer Front End as a reminder
  - WRRC drawings are great to cement why we are doing thing and where in that process we are
- **What** (10 min)
  - The WRRC should be coming more into focus now that we've built some of it out
  - The server should be feeding the front end actual data that works
  - Trello should be leading the way
- **How** (30 min)
  - Review the Trello board feature tasks & requirements
  - Review the City Explorer Front-End (matching it to the requirements)
  - Rebuild the Server, showing how it feeds the front end
  - Deploy it again, as a review.

### Promises and Async

- **Why** (5 min)
  - Node/Express takes advantage of javascript's asynchronous coding pattern
  - We don't want to always write "blocking" code
  - We don't always need to wait for code to complete
  - Javascript is really good at it -- we can use this idea to multi-task
- **What** (10 min)
  - The Event Loop and Call Stack
    - Detect async patterns and push that to the side for a while
  - Promises and Callbacks
- **How** (30 min)
  - Run a promise demo that showcases how things can be out of order
  - Focus on the syntax and when/how we process data
  - `.then()` and `.catch()` and how they interact with the process
- **Experimentation and Discovery Ideas**

### 3rd Party APIs

- **Why** (5 min)
  - All of the data in the world is literally all over the world
  - REST give us a common language and set of methods to access all of it, with WRRC
  - By using APIs in creative ways, you can make really interesting apps, but leave the data management to the experts
- **What** (10 min)
  - Identify the APIs that you need
  - Inspect the "shape" of the data and see if it conforms to your needs
  - Talk about communication via WRRC (now: server-side code is now the client!)
- **How** (30 min)
  - Demo the signup and access key retrieval process
    - Location IQ
    - Zomato
  - Integrate into your server application
    - Fetch Data
    - Massage it into shape (constructors)
    - Test with your client application
- **Experimentation and Discovery Ideas**

## Lab Notes

## What changed from the previous class?

- We will be refactoring our data fetchers from simply `require()` on a static .json file into pulling data from a live API with superagent, and having to wade through a promise to do so.
- We will truly be feeding the city explorer front end live data
  - This is an ongoing requirement for the week
- Not a lot of code movement (really a single change to the fetching functions), but a lot of cognitive changes for the students today as they wrestle with Promises both syntactically and conceptually

## What might students struggle with today?

- Promises and Async thought patterns
- Getting registered for their APIs

## Past bugs, issues or surprises...

- Remind students HOW to set their API environment options in Heroku
