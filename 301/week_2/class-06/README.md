# Good Day Happy Monday WEEK 2

- Feed Back.
    - Career work.
- Start with Warm - up
- Code Challenge Review
- Map and filter produce a new array. Reduce is typically used to
  "reduce" the array to a single value - a sum, a min/max, etc.
  There are more clever uses of reduce, and map/filter can be implemented using reduce.
- Code Lab Review. (Look at Routes.)
    - Code agnostics - meaning change the content without changing
     the   architecture. Add names to things by how they are used
     rather than what they represent in the structure of our documentation.
     So we name things for there purpose as opposed to where they are location.

## Repl-it

- Code Challenge for today pass by value and pass by reference.

## HTTP Methods

- Developers use HTTP methods to access APIs.
- GET: requests data from a server
- POST: sends new information to a server
- PUT: makes changes to existing data on a server
- DELETE: removes existing information from a server
- PATCH: used for partial updates
- There are more methods than these 5, but these are the most popular

## Intro to API

- Look at white boards
- Then go to star wars api, Look at objects and returned data
- we will use axios today to make these requests.
- go to <https://swapi.dev/>
- <https://swapi.dev/api/people/?pag=1>
- gets me several people.
- Look at the data and figure out the array data[objects]
- Start up app
- follow steps in demo

- Explain after list renders that data has costs and how larger
company's might handled thousands of requests and why we use Keys
for managing our data.

- go to location IQ website look at the keys
- Once demo is done review pull request and netlify
- add key from loqIq to netlify.
- trigger redeploy
- we are using trello for rest of project. don't wait longer than 15 minutes
 to get help.
- turn in what you get done.
- we will pick partners.
