# Good Day Happy Monday WEEK 2

- Feed Back.
    - Career work.
- Start with Warm - up
- Code Challenge Review
- Map and filter produce a new array. Reduce is typically used to
  "reduce" the array to a single value - a sum, a min/max, etc.
  There are more clever uses of reduce, and map/filter can be implemented using reduce.
- Code Lab Review. (Look at Routes.)
    - Code agnostics - meaning change the content without changing
     the   architecture. Add names to things by how they are used
     rather than what they represent in the structure of our documentation.
     So we name things for there purpose as apposed to where they are location.
