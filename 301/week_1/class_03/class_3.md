# Good Day Happy Day

## Warm-Up

- **Student Analysis** (5 min)
- **Debrief** (5-10 min)

### Shred Talk

- **Why**
  
- **What**

- **How** (10 min)

### Code Review

- TDD workflow with the class.
    - Every day a new branch
    - Every day a new file
    - TDD

## Mapping over data

- **Why** (5 min)
    - React is an excellent templating framework that allows us to take large datasets
     and map over them to display them
- **What** (10 min)
    - a built in array method that returns a new array
    - allows you to change the shape of the data
- **How** (30 min)
    - Explain Dry code.
    - Refactor the code, importing the data.json file and use .map() to render
     each component to the page.
    - First introduction to accessing properties from an object
     in an array. Go over where each value is coming from
      in addition to the syntax of using .map() in the JSX.

## Passing Functions as Props

- **Why** (5 min)
    - child components may need to interact with information in the parent
     component
    - child component may need to update state in the parent component
- **What** (10 min)
    - Parent component sends a function into the child component on the props
     that will allow the child component to interact with information in the parent
    component
      by invoking that function.
- **How** (50 min)
    - Demonstrate in demo: passing-functions
    - Use a lot of whiteboard drawings.
