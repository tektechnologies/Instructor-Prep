### Code Review
### Shred Talk



















---
## Ten Minute Break
- ## Second Hour
---
### Take a Look at the whiteBoard images 
### City Explorer Build
- **Why** (5 min)
  - This simple app is a great opportunity to revisit jQuery and dynamic data to cap off the week.
  - We provide them a more complex version of this same app during the next lesson block. This provides the students some context on that application when they see it again.
- **What** (5 min)
- **Experimentation and Discovery Ideas**
  - Get some suggestions from the students as how this app can be better
    - Multiple Cities
    - Movies, Nights Out, Trails, etc
    - What else can they think of?
  - Show the [official/deployed city explorer](https://codefellows.github.io/code-301-guide/curriculum/city-explorer-app/front-end/) to confirm their wishes

## Ten Minute Break
- ## Third Hour

### Deployments
- **Why** (5 min)
  - Websites don't run from laptops
  - Consumers need to get to actual sites/data
  - Explodes the notion of WRRC by adding a real server
- **What** (10 min)
  - Heroku is one (of many) services that can "host" a server
  - It can connect to GitHub to fetch your source code, install dependencies, and start your service
  - Other hosts (such as godaddy) are setup to host static websites (renting access to a folder)
- **How** (30 min)
  - Using a live-coded demo ...
    - Produce a simple express server with 2 routes (static and dynamic)
    - Deploy to Heroku
  - Sketch out the WRRC to demonstrate what is happening with the server and Heroku.
- **Experimentation and Discovery Ideas**
  - Replace the "hello world" index.html file with the city-explorer-lite app that you previously built.
  - Suggest that students can deploy their portfolios
