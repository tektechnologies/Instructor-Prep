## Lecture Outline

Below is the expected lecture outline and flow. One possible way to present this material is documented in the [example lecture](../facilitator/LECTURE-EXAMPLE.md) notes.

### Warm-Up

- **Student Analysis** (5 min)
  - Show or print the [warm-up code](../warm-up/warm-up.md)
- **Debrief** (5-10 min)
  - Refer to the [Warmup Notes](../warm-up/NOTES.md)
  - Optionally demo the running code at Repl.it

### Shred Talk

- **Why**
  - Daily "Shred Talks" introduce the student to a new javascript coding concept, setting them up to complete the daily "Code Challenge" series
- **What**
  - Refer to the [challenge documentation](../challenges/README.md)
- **How** (10 min)
  - Follow the [Demo Code](../challenges/DEMO.md)
- **Note**
  - If you are short on time, this can be omitted from class lecture. There are official videos that students can watch in lieu of you leading this portion of class.

### Code Review

### City Explorer Build

- **Why** (5 min)
  - This simple app is a great opportunity to revisit jQuery and dynamic data to cap off the week.
  - We provide them a more complex version of this same app during the next lesson block. This provides the students some context on that application when they see it again.
- **What** (5 min)
  - City Explorer accepts a city name, draws a map, and then lists out some interesting data about the city, pulled from a remote data source (client + server!)
  - Draw/Demonstrate the actual running City Explorer App
- **How** (30 min)
  - Using a live-coded demo ...
    - Build the HTML and CSS scaffolding of City Explorer, pulling in some sample data and rendering to the page
- **Experimentation and Discovery Ideas**
  - Get some suggestions from the students as how this app can be better
    - Multiple Cities
    - Movies, Nights Out, Trails, etc
    - What else can they think of?
  - Show the [official/deployed city explorer](https://codefellows.github.io/code-301-guide/curriculum/city-explorer-app/front-end/) to confirm their wishes

### Deployments

- **Why** (5 min)
  - Websites don't run from laptops
  - Consumers need to get to actual sites/data
  - Explodes the notion of WRRC by adding a real server
- **What** (10 min)
  - Heroku is one (of many) services that can "host" a server
  - It can connect to GitHub to fetch your source code, install dependencies, and start your service
  - Other hosts (such as godaddy) are setup to host static websites (renting access to a folder)
- **How** (30 min)
  - Using a live-coded demo ...
    - Produce a simple express server with 2 routes (static and dynamic)
    - Deploy to Heroku
  - Sketch out the WRRC to demonstrate what is happening with the server and Heroku.
- **Experimentation and Discovery Ideas**
  - Replace the "hello world" index.html file with the city-explorer-lite app that you previously built.
  - Suggest that students can deploy their portfolios

## Lab Notes

- Students will be executing a deployment as part of this lab.
- Refer them to the step by step instructions found in their README if they get stuck

## What changed from the previous class?

- Everything -- this is a new concept

## What might students struggle with today?

- The express server is a new concept

## Past bugs, issues or surprises...

## General Comments and Notes

For students enrolled in the daytime track, lab 5 will take place on Monday morning of class 6, with the assignments due before lecture.
