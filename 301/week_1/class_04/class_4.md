## Lecture Outline

Below is the expected lecture outline and flow. One possible way to present this material is documented in the [example lecture](../facilitator/LECTURE-EXAMPLE.md) notes.

### Warm-Up

- **Student Analysis** (5 min)
  - Show or print the [warm-up code](../warm-up/warm-up.md)
- **Debrief** (5-10 min)
  - Refer to the [Warmup Notes](../warm-up/NOTES.md)
  - Optionally demo the running code at Repl.it

### Shred Talk

- **Why**
  - Daily "Shred Talks" introduce the student to a new javascript coding concept, setting them up to complete the daily "Code Challenge" series
- **What**
  - Refer to the [challenge documentation](../challenges/README.md)
- **How** (10 min)
  - Follow the [Demo Code](../challenges/DEMO.md)
- **Note**
  - If you are short on time, this can be omitted from class lecture. There are official videos that students can watch in lieu of you leading this portion of class.

### Code Review

### CSS Grid

- **Why** (5 min)
  - Grid is the next generation of web page layout
  - Mimics a table structure, making it far easier to apply complex layouts
- **What** (10 min)
  - Grid uses a 2-D row and column layout system
  - Very reminiscent of using `<table />` to design sites years ago.
- **How** (30 min)
  - There's a short [Grid Demo](../demo/grid/) that shows how columns work.
  - Demonstrate the "Holy Grail" layout, progressing it from Float to Flex, to Grid.
    - Compare and contrast as you go.
- **Experimentation and Discovery Ideas**

### Regular Expressions

- **Why** (5 min)
  - Match Patterns in strings
    - "Find Stuff"
    - "Easy to remember" once you get over the hurdle
    - Every language supports these.
- **What** (10 min)
  - Matching rules within delimiters, followed by a modifier
  - `/abcdefg/ig`
    - `/` and `/` are the delimiters. The thing to match goes between them.
    - `ig` at the end are modifiers, meaning "Case Insensitive" and "Globally (don't stop when you find the first one)
    - The pattern to match (goes inside the delimiters)
      - Can contain raw characters, group indicators, and several special characters to change how the regex matches.
- **How** (30 min)
  - <http://www.regex101.com>
  - Demonstrate:
    - Basic string, number, special char matching
    - Groups
    - Starts/Ends with
    - Counting things (3 numbers)
- **Experimentation and Discovery Ideas**
  - If time allows, demonstration how to create a fuzzy search in the photo gallery solution code to search for images by matching keywords.

## Lab Notes

- This will be a solo lab - building out the first part of the portfolio
- The starter code is a template with a 5,000+ line .css file
- Students will need to modify the content and apply SMACSS rules to the css
