# Good Day Happy Thursday

- Event delegation:
- The things in the parent element that the event is delegated too.
- the div click would not run and we can change the div to the p tag to
   get the clock to fire.
- we can attach the click on the outter elements like if new p tags were
  rendered to the page it would still effect every p that was added.
- no doctype html at the top
- we never link to the app.js file.
- we are adding a click to the p tag if we click once
- we can leave the counter and comment out the extra click
- p tag is not a string line 26
- counter++ was being passed as a parameter which we dont do.
- it expects a  on(type, [delegated element], callbackfunction)

- Todays plan we are going to rebuild our lab from the start and discuss any
  questions that might come up.
- Then we are going to do some grid
- Then we will look at some regex.
- The lab today is somewhat short and deals with rebuilding lab one. And should
  not take to long.
- Else we should have some time to catch up on code challenges and other labs.
