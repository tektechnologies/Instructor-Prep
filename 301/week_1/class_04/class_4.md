# Good Day Happy Day

## Warm-Up

[Solution Code](./warm-up-solution.md)

## Code Challenge Review

## Lab Review

- Make drawing of where are app is now with state and props passing
- Use today's code review to go over a particular pain point that
   most of the class struggled with.

## Hour Two

### Shred Talk

- sorting by first letter but with string the values of lower vs uppercase are different.

## Start review of react

- npm create vite@latest
- create git hub and push
- create branch
- Delete old files
- Add Bootstrap to the project

## Hour Three

- Now lets do some react form stuff
- since we may have these values change lets keep track of them in state
- add a constructor
- wire up the select
- show how state is slow
- update map for sorted data and update the index for sorted data
- talk about bootstrap forms
- Talk about and draw the WRRC.

## Forms and Modals

- **Why**
    - Forms are one of the best ways for users to interact with an application
    - They allow us to collect all sorts of information from authenticating a user
      to writing a blog post
- **What**
    - A way to interact with a user and collect information
- **How**
- See the associated [warmup](../demo/forms-warmup) and [demo](../demo/forms-demo).
    - To run these, start with the warmup markdown file. Have students work in small
     groups to read the HTML and write the JS code.
    - After the students have mostly finished, review the solution together inside
     of the HTML and JS files.
    - Next, build up a demo of integrating the same exact event handlers into a
     React application. Show the differences in how we update state to render information.
    - Lastly, incorporate `react-bootstrap` and show how we can use a `Form` and
     `Form.Control` in the same way we would use a plain HTML `form` and `input`.
      (If possible, show how using the exact same event listener works for a React
       Bootstrap form or a plain HTML form.)
