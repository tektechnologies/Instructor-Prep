# Good Day Happy Tuesday Class 12

## Lecture Notes: Today we will look at create and delete for our database

- Saturday our lab content will be less so you will have some time to catch up.
- Lab material on Saturday will not be on the final assessment next tuesday.
- The final assesement is in person only.
- As well any subsequent attempts will be taken in the building as well.
- I am seeing some good team work on the Lab 10 and 11 thus far, nice work,
 remember that working in the software development industry is more than just
 knowing how to code. Keeping teams involved and communicating effective to
 resolve issue is very valuable.
