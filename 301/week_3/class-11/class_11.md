- what is the purpose of this code.
- arr[j]
- arr[j] + 1 // these are access locations.
- How does this sort?

- 10, 7, 3, 1, 9, 7,4, 3,
- 7, 10, 3, 1, 9, 7, 4, 3
- all the way to the end 7,3,1,9,7,4,3,10
- then
- 7, 3, 1, 9, 7, 4, 3, 10
- 3, 1, 7, 9, 7, 4, 3, 10
- 3, 1, 7,  7, 9, 4, 3, 10

then the 4 and the 3 make there way over

- 3, 1, 7,  7, 4, 3, 9,  10
- in one pass our numbers have become closer to where they want to be
- this is called a bubble sort.
- it scans the whole thing and passes the largest thing to the end.
