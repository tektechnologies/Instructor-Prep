# Good Day Happy Friday

## This has been a big week, thumbs up/down how are you feeling about this week

Below is the expected lecture outline and flow. One possible way to present this material is documented in the [example lecture](../facilitator/LECTURE-EXAMPLE.md) notes.

### Diversity and Inclusion (1 Hour)

> Discussion to be led by the campus director

### Course Wrap-Up

> Remind them ... they are now "Full Stack Web Developers"

- **Why** (5 min)
    - Remind students of all they have learned
    - Remind students of how much they can execute
- **What** (10 min)
    - HTML, CSS, Float, Flexbox, Grid, jQuery, Mustache, Templating, Express, EJS, Server Side Rendering, SPA, REST, API, SQL, Databases...
- **How** (30 min)
    - Lead a student driven discussion of all that they know and can execute. Write on the whiteboard as they call things out.
    - Ask questions afterwards about what types of applications can they recognize or have used in the past that use these technologies
    - Ask for ideas on things that they could now build with their new set of tools.

### Project Preparation

- **Why** (5 min)
    - In order to be successful in project week, organization is essential
    - Teams should be prepared to come in on the first day of project week ready to start coding
    - This removes stress and provides more time to execute
- **What** (10 min)
    - Teams should collectively agree on the basics of the project:
        - How will we work best together?
        - What are we building?
        - How are we planning to build it?
        - What will our workflow be?
- **How** (30 min)
    - Project Teams to complete a series of prep assignments
    - [Team Agreement](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/projects/Project_Prep_1)
    - [Project Description](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/projects/Project_Prep_2)
    - [Repo and Tooling](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/projects/Project_Prep_3)
    - [Wireframes, MVP, Feature Requirements](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/projects/Project_Prep_4)

## General Comments and Notes

Today wraps up the book app and starts the transition into project week. Spend time filling in any gaps from this project so students feel prepared to complete any remaining feature tasks before final projects kick off.

There are several assignments prior to the official start of final projects: finishing and submitting the book app, the small db normalization lab, and completing the week 3 survey. There are no resubmits allowed during final projects and any student whose grade is not at 90% after final projects will need special permission to resubmit additional assignments afterwards. Depending on the timeline for enrollment in 401, the timeline for these exceptions are important and the Admissions team should be included in the conversation.

```js
function fetchThing(url){
 return fetch(url)
 .then(result => { return result.json()
 .then(thing => {const names = things.map(..)});
 });

}

function logNames(names){
  console.log(names);
}
myPromise
.then(logNames);

myPromise
.then(console.log)
.catch(console.error);


app.get('/path', (req, res) => ...)


```
